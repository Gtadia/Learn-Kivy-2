# 1 
# This is an import statement in kivy   
#   Import "utils" from the "kivy.utils" package

# 2
# Labels don't have a background so we can't really change the background color

# 3 
# We are using the package imported by "kivy.utils" to convert the hex values into color
# We don't need "background_normal = '' " because textboxes are already white so the color is going to be accurate anyways 

# 4
# Because kivy is weird, the button's default/normal color is grey but if you don't remove this grey color, the background 
# color and the normal color will be mixed together
#
# That's why we have background_normal = '', which sets the "normal" color to nothing
