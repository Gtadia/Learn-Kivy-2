# pos_hint      Tells where the widgets should go
#
# {x, y, top, bottom, left, right}

# 3
# We're only going 0.7 for x because the position of the buttons are based from the bottom left corner and so 100% 
# would be completely off the screen.
#
# Furthermore, the button is 0.3 of the width of the screen so 1- 0.3 = 0.7
#
# OR we could have avoided this problem using "right": 0 instead

# 4
# It was already at the bottom

# 5
# 0.5 - (0.3/2) = 0.5 - 0.15 = 0.35
