# 1
# The spinner is a type of drop down menu (basically the same thing as the list dropdown menu)
#
# Normally, the dropdown menu wants to go below but the issue is that sometimes, you might not have enough space below
# so the dropdown menu shows up above the menu button

# 2 
# The values that go in the dropdown menu go in the "values" attributes as a list

# 3 
# on_text is basically on_press except that on_text runs the function when a menu value/item is clicked

# 4 
# This is just an empty label just here to create blank space for the dropdown menu to work
