<MyBoxLayout>
    BoxLayout:
        size: root.width, root.height       # 1
        orientation: "vertical"     # 2

        spacing: 20     # 3
        padding: 50 # 4 

        Button:
            text: "Hello"
        Button: 
            text: "How"
        Button:
            text: "Are"
        Button:
            text: "You"

            pos_hint: {"center_x": 0.5}
            size_hint: (None, None)
            width: 200
            height: 50      # 5

# 1
# The default size of the BoxLayout widget (and virtually every other widget) is 100 by 100 
# So you can fix this with "size" equalling the size of the window

# 2 
# With BoxLayout, we can choose to either stack the widgets vertically or horizontally
#
# "vertical"    or      "horizontal"

# 3
# "spacing" is the spacing between the buttons
# 
# spacing = 20      ==>         20 pixels of spacing

# 4
# You can add a padding around the entire BoxLayout "widget" 

# 5
# Just changing the sizing and position
