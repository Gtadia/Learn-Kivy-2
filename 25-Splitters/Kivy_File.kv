# 1 
# Splitter â€” split aparts different sections or Widgets and allow you to resize them on the fly 

# 2
# This specifies where you can resize the section ('bottom', 'top', 'left', 'right')
#
# REMEMBER: It's SIZable, not SIZEable (sizeable with the 'e' on "size")

# 3 
# The widgets that you want to resize are going to be sectioned off once they go under the scope of the Splitter.
# (You can have more than one widget to create a "section" that be be resized together)

# 4
# This is the same thing as adding a splitter with "sizeable_from: 'bottom'" on the widget above/Label widget above
