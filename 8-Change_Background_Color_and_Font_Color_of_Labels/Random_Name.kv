# 1 
# In order to change the "background" color of labels, we are just going to put a canvas behind the 
# label.

# 2 
# "self" refers to the Label widget (and "root" refers back to "MyLayout")
# 
# 2(b) and 2(c) just makes the rectangle the size of the label and puts it where the label is located

# 3
# We can change the styling of the font/text
# ** THIS CAN BE DONE FOR THE OTHER WIDGETS, SUCH AS BUTTONS **
